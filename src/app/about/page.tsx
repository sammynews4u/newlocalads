          <p className="mt-4 leading-7 text-gray-400">
            Local Ads is built for operators who are tired of vague marketing claims. Advertisers should know where their budget is going. Publishers should know what they are earning. Admins should have the tools to reject weak campaigns, verify sites and protect the network from fraud.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 leading-7 text-gray-400">
            The hard truth is that an advertising platform only becomes useful when it controls quality. That is why the product direction combines campaign creation, media upload, CTA guidance, publisher verification, CPC targeting, wallets, fraud review and conversion pixels.
